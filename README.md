Blockchain based money flow using QR code

As we know that there are many social payment options are available in the market like Venmo,Facebook messanger,Square cash where a person can easily transfer money from one to another through tweet,chat or email.
I think when money is being transferred  it should be  sent with QR code and if receiver goes to the ATM with that code and scans the QIR code to withdraw the money instantly .Now to solve the issue related to the ledger balancing and duplicate payment we can use Blockchain at the back end.On top of it can also support to the digital currencies like Bitcoin,Ethereum,Litecoin.
